                    <p>Charlotte “Charlie” Fisk Is a student in the Multimedia Production program. They enjoy escape
                        rooms because working through puzzles with a group makes both a fun bonding activity and is a
                        fun exercise in critical thinking, and problem solving. They also enjoy design (Specifically
                        character and prop design) a skill that they’re happy to improve on in design classes in the
                        course.
                        During their formative schooling years, they were regarded by teachers as the creative (and
                        nondisruptive) one of their classes. They have helped with a mural for an elementary school and
                        done several years of volunteer work at their local library. Charlie has three siblings and is
                        the middle child among them.
                        Their hobbies include Art, Video games, and scrolling on their phone for hours at a time. Some
                        of their favorite music artists include Freddie Mercury, Gotye, Autoheart, and many Vocaloid
                        artists (Flavor Folley, Jamie Page, SAWTOWNE, etc.…) Their chosen place to travel if ever given
                        the chance would be Venice and the surrounding Italian cities.
                        Outside of school they are slowly but surely working on several creative projects including
                        several Comics, Books, and a pitch for an animated TV show. Many inspirations of theirs are
                        animated tv shows like Gravity Falls, Over The Garden Wall, and The Owl House. Alongside some
                        smaller (But no less impressive) indie cartoons including Murder Drones, I Don’t Want To Be A
                        Magical Girl, and a more recent release Knights Of Guinevere.
